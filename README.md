This is a fan-made module meant for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition designed around the Super Mario series of games and media. It includes a module meant to be installed through the Foundry virtual table-top, along with a PDF file that goes over all of the content in the style of a DnD book.

To install the module manually into Foundry, download the .zip file and extract it to the modules folder in user data. To install it into Foundry via hyperlink, do the following

1.	In Foundry, go to the add-on module tab.
2.	Click Install Module.
3.	In the Manifest URL field, copy and paste the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiramarshiku/dnd5e-super-mario-edition/main/module.json

This module is a series of collections and has no mandatory requirements. However, there are some modules we advise using in conjunction with this module:

4.	Tokenizer to let people customie tokens: https://github.com/MrPrimate/tokenizer/releases/download/4.2.10/module.json
5.	No Token Animations to allow slow sliding to be turned off: https://bitbucket.org/Fyorl/notokenanim/raw/master/module.json
6.	Or any collection modules that add spells, items, or other content you desire.

Here is a list of things that are included in the PDF as well as the Foundry collections:

1.	14 playable species (aka races), including Birdo, Blooper, Bob-omb, Boo, Goomba, Human, Kong, Koopa Troopa, Penguin, Pianta, Piranha Plant, Shy Guy, Toad, and Yoshi.
2.	35 selectable subspecies (aka subraces) for the playable species.
3.	3 new sub-classes for each DnD class that attempt to synthesize DnD features with Mario themes. Some are altered from vanilla DnD, while others are completely custom.
4.	377 features, including racial, class, and background features.
5.	113 items that includes power-ups, blocks, and stars.
6.	10 custom-made maps of the Mario Universe that synthesize all of Mario lore into a comprehensible realm.
7.	23 languages for the Mushroom World and beyond. Note that these must be input manually in Foundry.
8.	Monster stat blocks were not implemented in the PDF nor Foundry, but included in the download is an excel spreadsheet with stat block information for 376 creatures that could possibly appear.
9.	A suggested main quest for an adventuring party to up the stakes in this fantasy world for a more serious but still fun campaign.

This Super Mario Edition has not been thoroughly tested, and as such there will undoubtably be balancing issues in it. We had a lot of fun making this, but we offer it as a framework with which you can play a Mario-themed adventure. Here are some screenshots of the content below.
